	is itself devoid of kinase activity (ErbB-3). The resulting signaling

	in comparative molecular field analysis has been investigated using
	a dataset of thermolysin inhibitors, and a comparison to the GRID

	the hydrogen-bond descriptors presently implemented in CoMSIA (comparative

	produced significantly improved statistics for the correlation analyses
	if they are exclusively applied or, even better, applied in c ombination
	with other CoMSIA descriptors. Two methodologically different approaches
	have been tested to approximate the developed descriptors. Both reduce
	significantly the required computational efforts in particular for
	large data sets. The graphical interpretation of the field contributions
	of hydrogen-bonding properties elucidates additional features compared
	to those obtained from the original CoMSIA method. They are of valuable

	with oestrogen-receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, emphasising
	the central role of oestrogen action in the development and progression

	compromised by acquired endocrine resistance, prompting the need
	for a greater understanding of the down-stream mediators of oestrogen
	action that may contribute to this effect. Recent studies have demonstrated
	a critical link between oestrogen's mitogenic effects and cell cycle
	progression, particularly at the G1 to S transition where key effectors
	of oestrogen action are c-Myc and cyclin D1, which converge on the
	activation of cyclin E-cdk2. These components are rapidly upregulated
	in response to oestrogen, and can mimic its actions on cell cycle
	progression, including re-initiating cell proliferation in antioestrogen-arrested
	cells. Here we review the roles of c-Myc, cyclin D1 and cyclin E
	in oestrogen action and endocrine resistance, and identify their
	potential as markers of disease progression and endocrine responsiveness,
	and as novel therapeutic targets in endocrine-resistant breast cancer.},

	component Tom20. In contrast to a previous report [Nuttal, S.D. et
	al. (1997) DNA Cell Biol. 16, 1067-1074], the present study using
	a newly-prepared anti-Tom34 antibody with a high titer showed that
	Tom34 is present largely in the cytosolic fraction and partly in
	the mitochondrial and membrane fractions after fractionation of tissues
	and cells, and that the membrane-associated form is largely extractable
	with 0.1 M sodium carbonate. The in vitro import of preproteins into
	isolated rat mitochondria was strongly inhibited by DeltahTom34 which
	lacks the NH2-terminal hydrophobic region of human Tom34 (hTom34).
	Import was also strongly inhibited by anti-hTom34. In pulse-chase
	experiments using COS-7 cells, pre-ornithine transcarbamylase (pOTC)
	was rapidly processed to the mature form. Coexpression of hTom34
	resulted in a stimulation of pOTC processing, whereas the coexpression
	of hTom34 antisense RNA caused inhibition. The results confirm that
	Tom34 plays a role in mitochondrial protein import in mammals, and
	suggest it to be an ancillary component of the translocation machinery
	in mammalian cells.},

	of human breast cancers and leads to a particularly aggressive form
	of the disease. Efficacy and safety of recombinant humanized anti-HER2
	monoclonal antibody as a single agent was evaluated in women with
	HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer that had progressed
	after chemotherapy for metastatic disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
	Two hundred twenty-two women, with HER2-overexpressing metastatic
	breast cancer that had progressed after one or two chemotherapy regimens,
	were enrolled. Patients received a loading dose of 4 mg/kg intravenously,
	followed by a 2-mg/kg maintenance dose at weekly intervals. RESULTS:
	Study patients had advanced metastatic disease and had received extensive
	prior therapy. A blinded, independent response evaluation committee
	identified eight complete and 26 partial responses, for an objective
	response rate of 15\% in the intent-to-treat population (95\% confidence
	interval, 11\% to 21\%). The median duration of response was 9.1
	months; the median duration of survival was 13 months. The most common
	adverse events, which occurred in approximately 40\% of patients,
	were infusion-associated fever and/or chills that usually occurred
	only during the first infusion, and were of mild to moderate severity.
	These symptoms were treated successfully with acetaminophen and/or
	diphenhydramine. The most clinically significant adverse event was
	cardiac dysfunction, which occurred in 4.7\% of patients. Only 1\%
	of patients discontinued the study because of treatment-related adverse
	events. CONCLUSION: Recombinant humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody,
	administered as a single agent, produces durable objective responses
	and is well tolerated by women with HER2-overexpressing metastatic
	breast cancer that has progressed after chemotherapy for metastatic
	disease. Side effects that are commonly observed with chemotherapy,
	such as alopecia, mucositis, and neutropenia, are rarely seen.},

	for human physiology, as well as rich information about human evolution.
	In 2001, the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium reported
	a draft sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome.
	Since then, the international collaboration has worked to convert
	this draft into a genome sequence with high accuracy and nearly complete
	coverage. Here, we report the result of this finishing process. The
	current genome sequence (Build 35) contains 2.85 billion nucleotides
	interrupted by only 341 gaps. It covers approximately 99\% of the
	euchromatic genome and is accurate to an error rate of approximately
	1 event per 100,000 bases. Many of the remaining euchromatic gaps
	are associated with segmental duplications and will require focused
	work with new methods. The near-complete sequence, the first for
	a vertebrate, greatly improves the precision of biological analyses
	of the human genome including studies of gene number, birth and death.
	Notably, the human genome seems to encode only 20,000-25,000 protein-coding
	genes. The genome sequence reported here should serve as a firm foundation
	for biomedical research in the decades ahead.},

  abstract = {The involvement of Ras in the activation of multiple early signaling
	pathways is well understood, but it is less clear how the various
	Ras effectors interact with the cell cycle machinery to cause G(1)
	progression. Ras-mediated activation of extracellular-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated
	protein kinase has been implicated in cyclin D(1) up-regulation,
	but there is little extracellular-regulated kinase activity during
	the later stages of G(1), when cyclin D(1) expression becomes maximal,
	implying that other effector pathways may also be important in cyclin
	D(1) induction. We have addressed the involvement of Ras effectors
	from the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and Ral-GDS families
	in G(1) progression and compared it to that of the Raf/mitogen-activated
	protein kinase pathway. PI 3-kinase activity is required for the
	expression of endogenous cyclin D(1) and for S phase entry following
	serum stimulation of quiescent NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Activated PI
	3-kinase induces cyclin D(1) transcription and E2F activity, at least
	in part mediated by the serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB, and to a
	lesser extent the Rho family GTPase Rac. In addition, both activated
	Ral-GDS-like factor and Raf stimulate cyclin D(1) transcription and
	E2F activity and act in synergy with PI 3-kinase. Therefore, multiple
	cooperating pathways mediate the effects of Ras on progression through
	the cell cycle.},

	S-systems are non-linear mathematical approximative models based
	on the power-law formalism. They provide a general framework for
	the simulation of integrated biological systems exhibiting complex
	dynamics such as genetic circuits, signal transduction and metabolic
	networks. We describe how the heuristic optimization technique Simulated
	Annealing can be effectively used for estimating the parameters of
	S-systems from time-course biochemical data. We demonstrate our methods
	using 3 artificial networks designed to simulate different network
	topologies and behavior. We then end with an application to a real
	biochemical network by creating a working model for the cadBA system

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {9},
  pages = {3},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput technologies like functional screens and
	gene expression analysis produce extended lists of candidate genes.
	Gene-Set Enrichment Analysis is a commonly used and well established
	technique to test for the statistically significant over-representation
	of particular pathways. A shortcoming of this method is however,
	that most genes that are investigated in the experiments have very
	sparse functional or pathway annotation and therefore cannot be the
	target of such an analysis. The approach presented here aims to assign
	lists of genes with limited annotation to previously described functional
	gene collections or pathways. This works by comparing InterPro domain
	signatures of the candidate gene lists with domain signatures of
	gene sets derived from known classifications, e.g. KEGG pathways.
	RESULTS: In order to validate our approach, we designed a simulation
	study. Based on all pathways available in the KEGG database, we create
	test gene lists by randomly selecting pathway genes, removing these
	genes from the known pathways and adding variable amounts of noise
	in the form of genes not annotated to the pathway. We show that we
	can recover pathway memberships based on the simulated gene lists
	with high accuracy. We further demonstrate the applicability of our
	approach on a biological example. CONCLUSION: Results based on simulation
	and data analysis show that domain based pathway enrichment analysis
	is a very sensitive method to test for enrichment of pathways in
	sparsely annotated lists of genes. An R based software package domainsignatures,
	to routinely perform this analysis on the results of high-throughput
	screening, is available via Bioconductor.},

  abstract = {Anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab is emerging as a frontline therapy
	for patients with metastatic breast cancers that overexpress HER2.
	Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which the antibody inhibits
	tumor growth should permit the design of even more effective trastuzumab-based
	protocols. Several groups including our own have demonstrated that
	induction of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27Kip1 protein
	is one of the key mechanisms of action of HER2-targeting antibodies.
	In this review, we discuss currently available data regarding the
	multiple signaling targets and pathways by which HER2-targeting antibodies
	upregulate p27Kip1 protein in breast cancer cells that overexpress
	HER2. Anti-HER2 antibodies inhibit HER2-mediated signaling in cancer
	cells, ultimately upregulating the levels and activity of p27Kip1
	protein. At least six signaling targets and pathways are modulated
	by trastuzumab. By inhibiting CDK2 and decreasing Thr187 phosphorylation
	of p27Kip1, trastuzumab abrogates targeting of SCF-ubiquitin E3 ligase
	and minimizes proteasome degradation of p27Kip1. By inhibiting AKT
	and human kinase interacting stathmin (hKIS), trastuzumab blocks
	Thr157-, Thr198- and Ser10-induced p27Kip1 translocation from the
	nucleus to the cytosol, which increases the inhibitory effect of
	p27Kip1. By inhibiting Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 (Jab1)
	trastuzumab increases nuclear retention of p27Kip1. By inhibiting
	cyclin D and c-Myc, trastuzumab releases the sequestrated p27bKip1
	protein from cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes and increase the effect of
	p27Kip1 on CDK2-cyclin E complexes. By stimulating minibrain related
	kinase (MIRK), trastuzumab stabilizes p27Kip1 in the nucleus, which
	increases inhibitory action of p27Kip1 on CDK2. The targets and pathways
	affected by trastuzumab work in concert to maximize the expression
	and inhibitory effect of p27Kip1, which leads to cell cycle G1 arrest
	and growth inhibition.},

	are now well established, the problem of defining functional relationships
	has been particularly daunting. Here, we present several manifold
	embedding techniques to compute distances between Gene Ontology (GO)
	functional annotations and consequently estimate functional distances
	between protein domains. To evaluate accuracy, we correlate the functional
	distance to the well established measures of sequence, structural,
	and phylogenetic similarities. Finally, we show that manual classification
	of structures into folds and superfamilies is mirrored by proximity
	in the newly defined function space. We show how functional distances
	place structure-function relationships in biological context resulting
	in insight into divergent and convergent evolution. The methods and
	results in this paper can be readily generalized and applied to a
	wide array of biologically relevant investigations, such as accuracy
	of annotation transference, the relationship between sequence, structure,
	and function, or coherence of expression modules.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Cluster analysis of genome-wide expression data from DNA
	microarray hybridization studies has proved to be a useful tool for
	identifying biologically relevant groupings of genes and samples.
	In the present paper, we focus on several important issues related
	to clustering algorithms that have not yet been fully studied. Results:
	We describe a simple and robust algorithm for the clustering of temporal
	gene expression profiles that is based on the simulated annealing
	procedure. In general, this algorithm guarantees to eventually find
	the globally optimal distribution of genes over clusters. We introduce
	an iterative scheme that serves to evaluate quantitatively the optimal
	number of clusters for each specific data set. The scheme is based
	on standard approaches used in regular statistical tests. The basic
	idea is to organize the search of the optimal number of clusters
	simultaneously with the optimization of the distribution of genes
	over clusters. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm has been
	evaluated by means of a reverse engineering experiment, that is,
	a situation in which the correct distribution of genes over clusters
	is known a priori. The employment of this statistically rigorous
	test has shown that our algorithm places greater than 90% genes into
	correct clusters. Finally, the algorithm has been tested on real
	gene expression data (expression changes during yeast cell cycle)
	for which the fundamental patterns of gene expression and the assignment
	of genes to clusters are well understood from numerous previous studies.
	Availability: The source code of the program implementing the algorithm
	is available upon request from the authors. Contact: alex_lukashin@biogen.com},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The availability of various high-throughput experimental
	and computational methods allows biologists to rapidly infer functional
	relationships between genes. It is often necessary to evaluate these
	predictions computationally, a task that requires a reference database
	for functional relatedness. One such reference is the Gene Ontology
	(GO). A number of groups have suggested that the semantic similarity
	of the GO annotations of genes can serve as a proxy for functional
	relatedness. Here we evaluate a simple measure of semantic similarity,
	term overlap (TO). RESULTS: We computed the TO for randomly selected
	gene pairs from the mouse genome. For comparison, we implemented
	six previously reported semantic similarity measures that share the
	feature of using computation of probabilities of terms to infer information
	content, in addition to three vector based approaches and a normalized
	version of the TO measure. We find that the overlap measure is highly
	correlated with the others but differs in detail. TO is at least
	as good a predictor of sequence similarity as the other measures.
	We further show that term overlap may avoid some problems that affect
	the probability-based measures. Term overlap is also much faster
	to compute than the information content-based measures. CONCLUSION:
	Our experiments suggest that term overlap can serve as a simple and
	fast alternative to other approaches which use explicit information
	content estimation or require complex pre-calculations, while also
	avoiding problems that some other measures may encounter.},

	influence an output or response, play an important role in biological
	systems. In many settings, Boolean functions provide a natural way

	we may wish to characterize such influences are usually subject to
	much variability. Furthermore, in high-throughput biological settings
	Boolean relationships of interest are very often sparse, in the sense
	of being embedded in an overall dataset of higher dimensionality.
	This motivates a need for statistical methods capable of making inferences
	regarding Boolean functions under conditions of noise and sparsity.
	RESULTS: We put forward a statistical model for sparse, noisy Boolean
	functions and methods for inference under the model. We focus on
	the case in which the form of the underlying Boolean function, as
	well as the number and identity of its inputs are all unknown. We
	present results on synthetic data and on a study of signalling proteins

	directed against HER-2. The objective response rate to trastuzumab

	point most patients become resistant to treatment. We created two
	trastuzumab-resistant (TR) pools from the SKBR3 HER-2-overexpressing
	breast cancer cell line to study the mechanisms by which breast cancer
	cells escape trastuzumab-mediated growth inhibition. Both pools maintained

	demonstrated a higher S-phase fraction by flow cytometry and a faster
	doubling time of 24-36 h compared with 72 h for parental cells. The
	cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(kip1) was decreased in TR cells,
	and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity was increased. Importantly,
	exogenous addition of p27(kip1) increased trastuzumab sensitivity.
	Additionally, resistant cells displayed heightened sensitivity to
	the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which induced p27(kip1) expression.
	Thus, we propose that trastuzumab resistance may be associated with
	decreased p27(kip1) levels and may be susceptible to treatments that

  year = {2008},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A fundamental problem when trying to define the functional
	relationships between proteins is the difficulty in quantifying functional
	similarities, even when well-structured ontologies exist regarding
	the activity of proteins (i.e. 'gene ontology' -GO-). However, functional
	metrics can overcome the problems in the comparing and evaluating
	functional assignments and predictions. As a reference of proximity,
	previous approaches to compare GO terms considered linkage in terms
	of ontology weighted by a probability distribution that balances
	the non-uniform 'richness' of different parts of the Direct Acyclic
	Graph. Here, we have followed a different approach to quantify functional
	similarities between GO terms. RESULTS: We propose a new method to
	derive 'functional distances' between GO terms that is based on the
	simultaneous occurrence of terms in the same set of Interpro entries,
	instead of relying on the structure of the GO. The coincidence of
	GO terms reveals natural biological links between the GO functions
	and defines a distance model Df which fulfils the properties of a
	Metric Space. The distances obtained in this way can be represented
	as a hierarchical 'Functional Tree'. CONCLUSION: The method proposed
	provides a new definition of distance that enables the similarity
	between GO terms to be quantified. Additionally, the 'Functional
	Tree' defines groups with biological meaning enhancing its utility
	for protein function comparison and prediction. Finally, this approach
	could be for function-based protein searches in databases, and for
	analysing the gene clusters produced by DNA array experiments.},

	in this paper. Molecule primitives are atoms, bonds, properties,
	branching, and rings. User-defined features can be added via a Java
	interface. In MQL, molecules are represented as graphs. Substructure
	matching was implemented using the Ullmann algorithm because of favorable
	run-time performance. The Ullmann algorithm carries out a fast subgraph
	isomorphism search by combining backtracking with effective forward
	checking. MQL software design was driven by the aim to facilitate
	the use of various cheminformatics toolkits. Two Java interfaces
	provide a bridge from our MQL package to an external toolkit: the
	first one provides the matching rules for every feature of a particular
	toolkit; the second one converts the found match from the internal
	format of MQL to the format of the external toolkit. We already implemented
	these interfaces for the Chemistry Development Toolkit.},

	we established a combinatorial RNAi strategy for systematic single,

	Our results show that the parallel knockdown of at least three different

	low. The technique was validated by investigating the interplay of
	tyrosine kinase receptor ErbB2 and its downstream targets Akt-1 and
	MEK1 in cell invasion. This experimental approach combines multiple
	gene knockdown with a subsequent quantitative validation of reduced
	protein expression and is a major advancement toward the analysis

  abstract = {Insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) is frequently overexpressed
	in several types of human malignancy and is associated with invasion
	and metastasis of tumor cells. Recently, IGF-IR expression was reported
	to be up-regulated in the human pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1
	when cells were stably transfected with active Src. The downstream
	targets of Src that lead to the up-regulation of IGF-IR expression
	were previously unknown. We demonstrate here that AKT regulates IGF-IR
	expression in PANC-1 and AsPC-1 cells. Cells transfected with active
	Src exhibited significantly more IGF-IR protein compared with vector-transfected
	cells. Overexpression of wild-type or constitutively active AKT (i.e.,
	AKT1 or AKT2) also resulted in elevated IGF-IR expression. IGF-IR
	protein levels were higher in cells transfected with constitutively
	active AKT than in cells transfected with active Src. In vitro kinase
	assays showed that AKT kinases are activated by active Src and inhibited
	by dominant negative Src or the tumor suppressor PTEN. Furthermore,
	AKT-induced IGF-IR expression was down-regulated by dominant-negative
	Src or PTEN. In addition, cells transfected with activated AKT in
	the presence of IGF-I were shown to have enhanced invasiveness compared
	with control cells. These data provide evidence for a link between
	AKT signaling and the regulation of IGF-IR expression and demonstrate
	that active AKT promotes the invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells
	through the up-regulation of IGF-IR expression.},

  abstract = {Proteomics has the potential to provide answers in cancer pathogenesis
	and to direct targeted therapy through the comprehensive analysis
	of protein expression levels and activation status. The realization
	of this potential requires the development of new, rapid, high-throughput
	technologies for performing protein arrays on patient samples, as
	well as novel analytic techniques to interpret them. Herein, we describe
	the validation and robustness of using reverse phase protein arrays
	(RPPA) for the analysis of primary acute myelogenous leukemia samples
	as well as leukemic and normal stem cells. In this report, we show
	that array printing, detection, amplification, and staining precision
	are very high, reproducible, and that they correlate with traditional
	Western blotting. Using replicates of the same sample on the same
	and/or separate arrays, or using separate protein samples prepared
	from the same starting sample, the intra- and interarray reproducibility
	was extremely high. No statistically significant difference in protein
	signal intensities could be detected within the array setups. The
	activation status (phosphorylation) was maintained in experiments
	testing delayed processing and preparation from multiple freeze-thawed
	samples. Differences in protein expression could reliably be detected
	in as few as three cell protein equivalents. RPPA prepared from rare
	populations of normal and leukemic stem cells were successfully done
	and showed differences from bulk populations of cells. Examples show
	how RPPAs are ideally suited for the large-scale analysis of target
	identification, validation, and drug discovery. In summary, RPPA
	is a highly reliable, reproducible, high-throughput system that allows
	for the rapid large-scale proteomic analysis of protein expression
	and phosphorylation state in primary acute myelogenous leukemia cells,
	cell lines, and in human stem cells.},

	from indirect regulatory effects from an interaction graph built
	up by error-prone measurements. Many of these algorithms can be cast
	as a rule for the removal of a single edge of the graph, such that
	the remaining graph is still consistent with the data. A set of mild
	conditions is given under which iterated application of such a rule
	leads to a unique minimal consistent graph. We show that three of
	the common methods for direct interactions search fulfill these conditions,
	thus providing a justification of their use. The main issues a reconstruction
	algorithm has to deal with, are the noise in the data, the presence
	of regulatory cycles, and the direction of the regulatory effects.
	We introduce a novel rule that, in contrast to the previously mentioned
	methods, simultaneously takes into account all these aspects. An
	efficient algorithm for the computation of the minimal graph is given,
	whose time complexity is cubic in the number of vertices of the graph.
	Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our method in a simulation

	of a set of genes that share a common role in the cell, such as a
	disease phenotype. The method extends the Nested Effects Model of
	Markowetz et al. (2005) by using a probabilistic factor graph to
	search for a network representing interactions among these silenced
	genes. The method also expands the network by attaching new genes
	at specific downstream points, providing candidates for subsequent
	perturbations to further characterize the pathway. We investigated
	an extension provided by the factor graph approach in which the model
	distinguishes between inhibitory and stimulatory interactions. We
	found that the extension yielded significant improvements in recovering
	the structure of simulated and Saccharomyces cerevisae networks.
	We applied the approach to discover a signaling network among genes
	involved in a human colon cancer cell invasiveness pathway. The method
	predicts several genes with new roles in the invasiveness process.
	We knocked down two genes identified by our approach and found that
	both knock-downs produce loss of invasive potential in a colon cancer
	cell line. Nested effects models may be a powerful tool for inferring

	in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis were 34\% (95\% CI, 23.9\%
	to 45.7\%) and 7\% (95\% CI, 0.8\% to 22.8\%), respectively. Seventeen
	(57\%) of 30 patients with an objective response and 22 (51\%) of
	43 patients with clinical benefit had not experienced disease progression
	at follow-up at 12 months or later. The most common treatment-related
	adverse events were chills (25\% of patients), asthenia (23\%), fever
	(22\%), pain (18\%), and nausea (14\%). Cardiac dysfunction occurred
	in two patients (2\%); both had histories of cardiac disease and
	did not require additional intervention after discontinuation of
	trastuzumab. There was no clear evidence of a dose-response relationship
	for response, survival, or adverse events. CONCLUSION: Single-agent
	trastuzumab is active and well tolerated as first-line treatment
	of women with metastatic breast cancer with HER2 3+ overexpression
	by IHC or gene amplification by FISH.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The standard L(2)-norm support vector machine (SVM) is
	a widely used tool for microarray classification. Previous studies
	have demonstrated its superior performance in terms of classification
	accuracy. However, a major limitation of the SVM is that it cannot
	automatically select relevant genes for the classification. The L(1)-norm
	SVM is a variant of the standard L(2)-norm SVM, that constrains the
	L(1)-norm of the fitted coefficients. Due to the singularity of the
	L(1)-norm, the L(1)-norm SVM has the property of automatically selecting
	relevant genes. On the other hand, the L(1)-norm SVM has two drawbacks:
	(1) the number of selected genes is upper bounded by the size of
	the training data; (2) when there are several highly correlated genes,
	the L(1)-norm SVM tends to pick only a few of them, and remove the
	rest. RESULTS: We propose a hybrid huberized support vector machine
	(HHSVM). The HHSVM combines the huberized hinge loss function and
	the elastic-net penalty. By doing so, the HHSVM performs automatic
	gene selection in a way similar to the L(1)-norm SVM. In addition,
	the HHSVM encourages highly correlated genes to be selected (or removed)
	together. We also develop an efficient algorithm to compute the entire
	solution path of the HHSVM. Numerical results indicate that the HHSVM
	tends to provide better variable selection results than the L(1)-norm
	SVM, especially when variables are highly correlated. AVAILABILITY:

  abstract = {TR4 is a new member of the nuclear hormone receptor family. This receptor
	is highly conserved in rat and human, but an in-frame insertion of
	19 amino acid residues in the amino-terminal (A/B) region was found
	in the human homolog, which we refer to as hTR4alpha1. By reverse
	transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) we have identified a human TR4 mRNA (hTR4alpha2)
	that is analogous in size and sequence to the reported rat TR4. RT-PCR
	analysis using total RNA derived from various rat tissues revealed
	a new rat TR4 transcript, referred to as rTR4alpha1, which is homologous
	to hTR4alpha1 since it contains the extra 19 amino acids in the A/B
	region. The two rat transcripts showed a differential tissue distribution.
	Analysis of the exon-intron organization of the hTR4 A/B region showed
	that the 19-amino-acid peptide insert in hTR4alpha1 was encoded by
	a separate exon, indicating that hTR4alpha1 and hTR4alpha2 transcripts
	were produced by the differential usage of the exon. RT-PCR analysis
	revealed that both hTR4alpha1 and hTR4alpha2 were detectable in brain,
	placenta, and ovary. In contrast, the human ovarian cancer cell line,
	PA1, failed to express hTR4alpha1. By fluorescence in situ hybridization,
	we have mapped the hTR4 gene to 3p25, a region deleted in some forms
	of cancer.},

  abstract = {Receptor tyrosine kinases of the ErbB family are implicated in a number
	of cancers, including that of the breast. ErbB receptors are activated
	by ligand-induced formation of homodimers and heterodimers. Receptor
	heterodimerization is thought to play a critical role in breast cancers
	overexpressing multiple members of the ErbB family. Although coexpression
	of ErbB receptors is associated with poor patient prognosis, the
	mechanisms by which receptor heterodimerization regulates tumor progression
	are not clear, due in part to a lack of methods that allow controlled
	activation of specific receptor heterodimers in mammary epithelial
	cells. Here, we report an approach to activate ErbB1-ErbB2 heterodimers
	in a nontumorigenic breast epithelial cell line, MCF-10A, without
	interference from endogenous ErbB receptors. Using such a method,
	we show that whereas both ErbB2 homodimers and ErbB1-ErbB2 heterodimers
	were equally potent in activating the Ras/mitogen-activated protein
	kinase pathway, the heterodimers were more potent in activating the
	phosphoinositide 3'-kinase (PI3K) and phospholipase Cgamma1 pathways
	than ErbB2 homodimers. We combined the dimerization system with a
	three-dimensional cell culture approach to show that whereas both
	ErbB2 homodimers and ErbB1-ErbB2 heterodimers induced disruption
	of three-dimensional acini-like structures, only heterodimers promoted
	invasion of cells through extracellular matrix. The ability of heterodimers
	to induce invasion required the ErbB1 kinase activity and required
	activation of PI3K, Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase, and phospholipase
	Cgamma1 signaling pathways. Thus, we have identified cell invasion
	as a heterodimer-specific biological outcome and suggest that coexpression
	of ErbB1 may critically regulate invasive progression of ErbB2-positive
	breast cancers.},
