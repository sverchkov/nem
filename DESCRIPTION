Description: The package 'nem' allows to reconstruct features of
        pathways from the nested structure of perturbation effects. It
        takes as input (1.) a set of pathway components, which were
        perturbed, and (2.) phenotypic readout of these perturbations
        (e.g. gene expression, protein expression). The output is a
        directed graph representing the phenotypic hierarchy.
