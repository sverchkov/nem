Title: Nested Effects Models to reconstruct phenotypic hierarchies
Version: 2.3.1
Author: Florian Markowetz, Holger Froehlich, Achim Tresch, Matthias Maneck, Claudio Lottaz, Tim Beissbarth
Description: The package 'nem' allows to reconstruct features of pathways from the nested structure of perturbation effects. It takes as input (1.) a set of pathway components, which were perturbed, and (2.) high-dimensional phenotypic readout of these perturbations (e.g. gene expression or morphological profiles). The output is a directed graph representing the phenotypic hierarchy.
